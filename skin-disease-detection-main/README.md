# skin-disease-detection
This is the backend of the skin disease detection using image processing on google colab

# Abstract
 Using image processing and machine learning technology, the diagnosis of skin diseases has been
 already proven to have promising prospects of helping doctors make better dermatology examinations.
 The possibilities for extension of this model entail several areas of concern for development and
 improvement. Extending the training data set applying to the model creates the possibility of including a
 multitude of skin types. It also helps to improve the model's capability of perceiving and recognizing a
 broader variety of conditions. Alongside advanced imaging processing techniques, the ability to locate
 more accurate features of the skin lesion images and an improvement of accuracy in skin disease
 diagnosis and classification can be explored. Integration of one or the other machine learning algorithms
 like ensemble learning or transfer learning can intensify the sharing of the model's performance and
 acceptance. Moreover, the model will be able to sync with telemedicine platforms and mobile
 applications, bringing the possibility of remote diagnosis and observation of skin diseases, which in turn
 will result in the broadening of reach and penetration of healthcare services. These advances could be of
 great importance for dermatology due to the possibility of finding reliable and effortless data processing
 tools to differentiate skin diseases based on image processing techniques

 # problem statement
  Skin diseases are common health problems that affect people's lives. Early detection and accurate
  diagnosis are crucial for effective treatment. However, there is a shortage of dermatologists, especially
  in remote areas. This project aims to develop an automated skin disease detection system using image
  processing and machine learning techniques to assist in the diagnosis process.

 # Methodology
  The system uses deep learning models trained on skin lesion images to classify different types of skin
  diseases. The backend is built using Python with Flask/Quart framework, and integrates TensorFlow/Keras
  for the machine learning model.

 # Features
  - Image upload and processing
  - Skin disease classification using deep learning
  - RESTful API for integration with mobile/web applications
  - Database for storing predictions and analysis history
